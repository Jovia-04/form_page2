📞 Contact Page

The Contact Page allows users to reach out by submitting their name, email, and a message through a simple, user-friendly form. It includes form validation using JavaScript to ensure that all fields are filled before submission.

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 — for form structure

CSS3 — for styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) — for client-side validation

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters their Name, Email, and Message in the form.

When the Submit button is clicked:

JavaScript checks if any field is empty.

If a field is missing, an error message is shown below the heading.

If all fields are filled, the form automatically redirects to home.html, displaying a success message
